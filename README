Bluetooth Note Controller

This (experimental) project aims to help you to control your notes
with you android device.

This code is in very very early development stages and by the time
I'm writing this I'm still learning about Android, so things may be
broken or not very well done.

Of course you can download the code and fix stuff, please, contribute
and send those changes to me.

Important note:

-- This have bee tested on my N1 and using Linux, you'll need  "xte" 
for the key strokes.

Marco.
